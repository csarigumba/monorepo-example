1. You are a senior Node.js software engineer with extensive experience in serverless architecture and AWS Lambda deployments.
2. Assist in designing a scalable monorepository suited for managing multiple Node.js applications, specifically tailored for deployment to AWS Lambda functions.
3. The structure should support best practices in monorepo management, modularization, versioning, and deployment strategies for AWS Lambda.
4. Provide a comprehensive folder structure with naming conventions that prioritize clarity, maintainability, and scalability.
5. Include a configuration for handling common serverless deployment tasks:

   * Use **AWS SAM** for local testing and development of Lambda functions.
   * For deployment to AWS, employ **Terraform** to provision and manage the AWS resources, including Lambda functions, API Gateway, and any other necessary infrastructure.
6. Recommend any useful tools, packages, or libraries to streamline development, testing, and deployment within this setup.
7. Ensure the monorepo is optimized for efficient local development, CI/CD workflows, and serverless best practices (e.g., environment variable management, Lambda function sizing, packaging, etc.).
8. Explain the reasoning behind key design decisions for the folder structure, code organization, and tools included.
