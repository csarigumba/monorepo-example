1. Create the REQUIREMENTS.md first.
  - we can ask ai to generate the requirements but its important to review this.
  - Example prompt: Create requirement file using the aws architecture in docs\diagram\diagram.png
2. Using the REQUIREMENTS.md file, update the INSTRUCTIONS.md file properly since it will be the context that will be given to the GenAI.
3. Add the input JSON in the directory "docs\input"
  - it is better if we deploy it by batch so that task is not too big for GenAI.
  - in this example, it is by batch.
    - batch1
    - batch2
    - etc.
4. Proceed on deploying the batch by starting in 1.
  - prompt: docs\images\prompt1.png
  - proceed until all batch is completed.
  - check and refactor the code. VERY IMPORTANT!
