### **Requirements Definition: Pet Management REST API**

**1. Introduction & Overview**

This document outlines the functional, technical, and non-functional requirements for a REST API designed to manage pet data. The system will be built on a serverless architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and managed via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The purpose of this project is to provide a scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient solution for creating and retrieving pet information, as demonstrated in the sample implementation.

**2. System Architecture**

The system follows a classic serverless pattern. A client interacts with an AWS API Gateway, which securely exposes the API endpoints. Requests are routed to an AWS Lambda function that contains the core business logic. This function processes the request and interacts with an AWS DynamoDB table to persist and retrieve pet data.

**3. Functional Requirements**

The API must provide the following capabilities for managing pet resources:

* **FR-01: Create a New Pet Record**
    * **Description:** The system shall allow a client to add a new pet to the database.
    * **Method:** `POST`
    * **Endpoint:** `/pets`
    * **Payload (Request Body):** A JSON object containing the pet's attributes (e.g., name, species, age).
    * **Response:** A JSON object confirming the creation and returning the unique ID of the newly created pet.

* **FR-02: Retrieve Pet Record(s)**
    * **Description:** The system shall allow a client to retrieve one or more pet records from the database.
    * **Method:** `GET`
    * **Endpoint (for a specific pet):** `/pets/{petId}`
    * **Endpoint (for all pets):** `/pets`
    * **Response:** A JSON object containing the data for the requested pet(s).

**4. Technical Requirements**

The implementation must adhere to the following technical specifications:

* **TR-01: Cloud Provider:**
    * The entire infrastructure must be deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

* **TR-02: Architecture Style:**
    * The system must be implemented using a **Serverless Architecture**.

* **TR-03: Infrastructure as Code:**
    * All cloud resources must be defined and managed using **Terraform**.

* **TR-04: API Layer:**
    * **AWS API Gateway** must be used to create and manage the RESTful endpoints.
    * The API Gateway shall be named following the convention: `ge-${yourname}-pet-api`.

* **TR-05: Compute Layer:**
    * All application logic must be executed by an **AWS Lambda** function.
    * The Lambda function shall be named following the convention: `ge-${yourname}-save-pet-function`.

* **TR-06: Data Storage:**
    * Pet data must be stored in an **AWS DynamoDB** table.
    * The DynamoDB table shall be named following the convention: `ge-${yourname}-pets`.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-01: Scalability:** The system must automatically scale to handle variable loads of incoming API requests.
* **NFR-02: Availability:** The system should be highly available, leveraging the inherent resilience of the managed AWS services.
* **NFR-03: Performance:** API response times should be low, providing a fast experience for the client.
* **NFR-04: Security:** The API Gateway endpoints should be secured against unauthorized access.

**6. Data Model**

The `Pet` entity stored in DynamoDB should contain at least the following attributes:

| Attribute Name | Data Type | Description                                        | Key Type      |
| :------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `petId`        | String    | A unique identifier for the pet (e.g., a UUID).    | Partition Key |
| `name`         | String    | The name of the pet.                               |               |
| `species`      | String    | The species of the pet (e.g., "Dog", "Cat").       |               |
| `age`          | Number    | The age of the pet in years.                       |               |
| `createdAt`    | String    | The ISO 8601 timestamp of when the record was created. |               |
